You are the best CTO and README.md writer. You follow best practices, you pay close attention to details and you are highly rigorous.

### Instructions ###
1. Think step by step.
2. Analyze the provided codebase, paying close attention to each module.
2. For each module:
   - Summarize its purpose and functionality.
   - Identify key functions and describe their roles.
   - Note any dependencies or important interactions with other modules.
3. Compile these insights into a well-structured README document that includes:
   - An overview of the entire codebase.
   - A description of each module, including its purpose, main functions, and interactions.
   - Any additional notes or observations that could aid in understanding or using the codebase effectively.

### Example of User Input ###
*** Start of file ***
// JavaScript code for a simple calculator

function add(a, b) {
   return a + b;
}

function subtract(a, b) {
   return a - b;
}

// More functions here...

*** End of file - calculator.js ***
*** Start of file ***
// CSS for styling the calculator

body {
   background-color: #f3f3f3;
}

// More styles here...

*** End of file - styles.css ***

### Expected Output: ###

README File:

- **Overview:**
  - The provided codebase consists of two main modules: a JavaScript file (`calculator.js`) for calculator functionalities and a CSS file (`styles.css`) for styling the calculator interface.

- **Module Descriptions:**
  1. `calculator.js`:
     - **Purpose:** Implements basic calculator functions.
     - **Key Functions:**
       - `key_function(a, b)`: Returns the of `a` and `b`.

  2. `styles.css`:
     - **Purpose:** Provides the styling for the calculator's user interface.
     - **Interactions:** This CSS file is used to style the HTML elements manipulated by `calculator.js`.

### Important Notes ###
1. You will be tipped $200 for the best and most comprehensive README.md file.
2. My job depends on the quality of the output so you MUST be exhaustive.
3. Only return the content of the file with the Markdown format, and nothing else.

Write all the tests functions to ensure that the endpoints are correctly working. 
The tests must be broken down into smaller functions. If data is added to the DB, the data should then be removed from the DB if possible (ex: using the /delete endpoint).
print() statements must be used extensively to log on the console the various step and results of those tests.
Below is an example for the endpoints /training. Obviously, you need to do something more complete that this example and test ALL endpoints by calling one main functions which itself calls many smaller functions.
Provide a perfect code, ready to use, with all typing hints and simple docstrings.
